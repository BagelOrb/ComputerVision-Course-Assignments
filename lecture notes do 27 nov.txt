+===========+


track state space

example includes bounding box in 2D of red players
example 2 : feature points in 2D, in 3D


batch tracking:
estimating whole sequence afterwards
=> can interpolate for frames which are unclear



online tracking:
---------------
predicts next state

mistakes are propagated forward






--------------------------
Kalman filters
-----------
current sttate based on prev state

error = gaussian (?!)

observations: cluster center (noisy!)
state: position, and speed

Kalman filter filters the noise and estimate smoothly the speed and pos


observation wrong vs prediction wrong
---
based on the covariance matrix of the error (?!)

covariance determines teh Kalman gian (?!)



state propagation
------
prediction: new pos = old pos + speed (+ acceleration)
acceleration is difficult

gaussian on current position predicted

x^-_k : "^-" = initial guess! at time k


Kalman gain determines the impact of the update
when observation is unlikely it is not weighed as much








Particle filter
----------------------\

alternative tracks

estimating cluster labels immediately

n particles : n possible tracks of one person

patch = bounding box (2D)

particle weight : how good the estimate is based on for example color information
	overlap between actual voxels and estimated voxels (3D cylinder at estimated location)
	=> state includes 3D (simple) model
.	
	
3 alternatives:
	- take best particle
	- use the weighted average of all particles (distadvantage from outliers, and from other people)
	- estimate distribution model over particles
	  \/

Gaussian mixtue model
problem: weighted particles are generally not normally distributed




where to place the particles?
-----
alternatives:
	stay uniformly distributed
	further away particles are resampled
		particles move along the direction of the subject

Sequential Importance Resampling
------------------------------
normalize weights to sum up to 1
use weights as prob distr?!

see slides!!!

add a bit of noise/.....
