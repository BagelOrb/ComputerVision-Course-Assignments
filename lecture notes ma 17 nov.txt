Silhouette-based volume reconstruction  |  [Part 1]
----------------------------------------+----------

2d point in image = line in 3d

triangulation : intersect the two lines corresponding to two corresponding pixels/points

multiple view stereo : stereo vision for each pair of two camera's
=> extrinsics and inricsics estimated simultaneously with depth extraction 

shape from motion : ... from video




silhouette carving
------------------
carve a mesh by intersecting volumes corresponding to 2d polygons in the pictures
=> computationally expesive!

rather use voxels

typically 64x64x64
=> 256k volume
(RAM expensive (?))
computationally fast ==> oct-trees


look-up table : mapping from voxels to pixels (?)


limitations:
- typically small number of views
- cavaties not reconstructed (TK: only the convex hull)
- ...?!
- conservative: actual shape is smaller than the estimate
- incorrect background substraction leeds to noisy silhouettes (omission of parts, and addition)


'algorithm':
1.calibrate
2.background subtraction
3.carve


common assumptions:
-background distinguishable by color (green screen)
-background is static



challenges:
- color variation over time
- overlap in color betwen fore and background
- shadows > colors of background affected by foreground
- moving background
- 

(have a different threshold for darker colors than for lighter pixels)

shadows (typically) don't change the hue!

aliasing = the averaging of neighboring pixel values
=> has more effect where the contrast is high



noise reduction:
----------------
- erosion (eat away white pixels)
- dilation (fill black holes)



Gaussian mixture models
-----------------------
keep more info than just 'THE' color of a pixel

-> fit normal distribution of a pixel

set threshold in terms of number of standard deviations

not a single snapshot of background, but multiple frames


problem : red light that is on half of the time
solution: gaussian mixture model!

=> one normal for off, one for on

can be used for shadows as well
... reflections..
